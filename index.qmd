<h1><b>Validation of a readiness to train scale</b></p></h1>

<h2>Thank you again for agreeing to participate in our readiness to train scale validation study.</h2>
<p>As a reminder, the purpose of this research project is to construct validate a reporting tool (ensure it measures what it is supposed to), to be used by exercise oncology professionals to capture patient-reported readiness to train in the cancer population. The outcome of the research will be a tool to enhance the ability of the exercise oncology professional to apply autoregulated exercise to accommodate the daily fluctuations of oncology populations, and subsequently, their readiness to train.</p>

<h2><b>Participation</b></h2> 
<p>If you’re still willing to participate in this research project, you will be asked to complete a six-question readiness to train survey during each of your exercise sessions over a two-week period at three timepoints per session:  
<ul><li>Immediately prior to commencing your exercise session (Number 1 – Pre-session); 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>following your warm-up (Number 2 – Post warm-up);</li></ul>
</li>and within thirty minutes of completing your exercise session (Number 3 – Post session).</ul></p>

<p>The survey will take approximately one minute to complete each time.</p>  

<p>Your survey data is completely de-identified, coded through your unique identifier so that it is only potentially re-identifiable to the research team.</p>

<p>To allow you to partake in this study, you have previously provided written consent for this project; by proceeding to complete the surveys (forms linked below) you are consenting to your data being used for the research purposes described above. Please note that your participation is voluntary. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw at any time by contacting the Chief Investigator [<a href="mailto:grose1@usc.edu.au">Contact</a>].</P>

<h2><b>What to do now</b></h2>
<p>Please use the buttons below to complete your three surveys within your current exercise session. If you have any immediate questions about the scales contained within that survey or what you need to please refer to this FAQ document, or speak to your exercise physiologist.</p>
