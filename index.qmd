<h3><p><b>Thank you again for agreeing to participate in our readiness to train scale validation study</h3></b></p>

<p>As a reminder, this study involves completing a brief 6-question survey about how you feel before exercise, after the warm-up, and on completion of your exercise session.</p>
</h3>

<p><b>How much time will this take?</B>  
  The survey will take approximately 1 minute to complete each time</p>

<p><b>When do I need to complete this survey?</b>  
We ask that you complete this survey at <b>three time points:</b> 
<ul><li>Immediately prior to commencing your exercise session (<b>Pre-session – Survey #1</b>); 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>After your warm-up but before your exercise session (<b>Post-warm-up – Survey #2</b>); and</li></ul>
<ul><li>Within thirty minutes of completing your exercise session (<b>Post-session – Survey #3</b>)</li></ul></p>

<p><b>How often do I need to complete this survey?</b>  
We ask that you repeat this process every time you come to the gym over the next <b>four</b> consecutive exercise sessions. </p>

<p><b>Why should I participate?</b>     
Your participation will help us design a tool for exercise physiologists and physiotherapists to support people living with and beyond cancer exercise optimally during their good and bad days.</p>

<p><b>Will my answers remain confidential?</b>  
Your answers will be de-identified and will remain confidential within the research team.
</p>

<p><b>Is participation voluntary?</b>
