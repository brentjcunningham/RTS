    "text": "Validation of a readiness to train scale\n\n\n\nThank you again for agreeing to participate in our readiness to train scale validation study.\n\n\nAs a reminder, the purpose of this research project is to construct validate a reporting tool (ensure it measures what it is supposed to), to be used by exercise oncology professionals to capture patient-reported readiness to train in the cancer population. The outcome of the research will be a tool to enhance the ability of the exercise oncology professional to apply autoregulated exercise to accommodate the daily fluctuations of oncology populations, and subsequently, their readiness to train.\n\n\nParticipation\n\n\nIf you’re still willing to participate in this research project, you will be asked to complete a six-question readiness to train survey during each of your exercise sessions over a two-week period at three timepoints per session:\n\n\nImmediately prior to commencing your exercise session (Number 1 – Pre-session);\n\n\n\n\nfollowing your warm-up (Number 2 – Post warm-up);\n\n\nand within thirty minutes of completing your exercise session (Number 3 – Post session).\n\n\nThe survey will take approximately one minute to complete each time.\n\n\nYour survey data is completely de-identified, coded through your unique identifier so that it is only potentially re-identifiable to the research team.\n\n\nTo allow you to partake in this study, you have previously provided written consent for this project; by proceeding to complete the surveys (forms linked below) you are consenting to your data being used for the research purposes described above. Please note that your participation is voluntary. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw at any time by contacting the Chief Investigator [Contact].\n\n\nWhat to do now\n\n\nPlease use the buttons below to complete your three surveys within your current exercise session. If you have any immediate questions about the scales contained within that survey or what you need to please refer to this FAQ document, or speak to your exercise physiologist.\n\n \n  \n    Number 1 - Pre-session \n  \n  \n    Number 2 - Post-warm up \n  \n  \n    Number 3 - Post-session \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFor any further questions, please contact Brent Cunningham (PhD student)"

    "text": "A quick reminder of the process\n\n\nOver your next four exercise sessions you will complete each of surveys three times during your exercise session.\n\n\n\nPre-session – prior to starting exercise\n\n\n\n\nPost warm-up – following your warm-up or after 5 minutes of movement\n\n\n\n\nPost session – complete within 30 minutes of completing your exercise session\n\n\n\nWhen you click on the link to a survey, it will open a new tab. When you’ve submitted your survey responses you can close the tab.\nEach time you wish to complete the next survey, simply open the webpage again and click the link for the next survey.\nI suggest adding the webpage to your home screen for convenience as you can simply click this each time you attend your exercise session or each time you need to complete the survey.\n\nCreate Website Shortcut\nThe home screen on your smartphone or tablet isn’t just a place where your apps live. You can also add shortcuts to websites. Here’s how to create an “app” for any website on your device, allowing you to access shortcuts directly from your home screen.\niPhone or iPad\n\nOpen Safari. Other browsers, such as Chrome, won’t work for this.\nNavigate to the website you want to save to your home screen by entering the URL of the website you want to create a shortcut to. Make sure you visit the exact page you want to open through the shortcut. Tap “Go.”\nTap the Share button on the bottom of the page. It looks like a square with an arrow pointing out of the top.\nIn the list of options that appear, scroll down until you see Add to Home Screen. Tap this. The Add to Home Screen dialog box will appear.\nChoose a name for the website shortcut on your home screen. You’ll see the link so you can confirm it, as well as the site’s favicon that will appear as the “app” icon on your home screen. Click Add when you’re done. Safari will close automatically, and you will be taken to where the icon is located on your iPhone’s or iPad’s home screen.\nNow just tap the new “app” or shortcut on your home screen, and it will open the website in its own navigation window, independent of what you have open in Safari.\nNote: If you ever decide you want to remove the website shortcut, you can delete it just like you would any other app on your phone.\n\nAndroid\n\nOpen Chrome.\nNavigate to the website or web page you want to pin to your home screen.\nTap the menu icon (3 dots in upper right-hand corner) and tap Add to home screen.\nChoose a name for the website shortcut, then Chrome will add it to your home screen."
