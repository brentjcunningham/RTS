The outcome of the research will be a tool to enhance the ability of the exercise oncology professional to apply autoregulated exercise to accommodate the daily fluctuations of oncology populations, and subsequently, their readiness to train.\n\n\nParticipation\n\n\nIf you agree to participate in this research project, you will be asked to complete a six-question readiness to train survey during each of your exercise sessions over a two-week period at three timepoints: immediately prior to commencing your exercise session; following your warm-up; and within thirty minutes of completing your exercise session. The survey will take approximately one minute to complete each time. Upon completion of the two-week period, you will be asked to answer a series of questions aimed at providing feedback on the scale. The scale and the feedback section will ask questions such as:\n\n\nRate your energy levels on a 1-5 scale today.\n\n\n\n\nProvide feedback about what you thought the scale was asking.\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked for identifying details at the beginning of each survey to allow us to match your data across time. Upon completion of all surveys, your identifying details will be removed, and your data will be given a code so that it is only re-identifiable to the research team.\n\n\nYour participation is voluntary. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw at any time. You will need to provide the researchers with your name to have your data removed. Please contact the Chief Investigator (contact) to discuss withdrawal.\n\n\nConsent\n\n\nConsent to participate will be confirmed before progressing to the survey AND you will be asked to provide written consent for the project. Consent is for your data and information to be collected in are-identifiable format, stored in a re-identifiable format, and used in analysis and publications in a non-identifiable format.\n\n\nContact"
